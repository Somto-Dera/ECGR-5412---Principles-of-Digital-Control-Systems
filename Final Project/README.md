# Final Project Description


1. Each group was provided a plant function Gp(s) for a system.
2. The overall goal of the project is to design two different digital controllers to meet design goals below within the design constraints below:
    - The first system design has the block diagram, where D(z) is the classical digital compensator (either a digital PID or digital lag-lead).
    - The second system design is state variable, using state-variable observer+controller compensation.

3. Report the results.
