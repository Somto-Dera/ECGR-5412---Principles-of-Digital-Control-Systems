# Graduate Project

1. Summarize the following IEEE paper regarding the use of non-Foster circuits (such as negative capacitors) 
    P.J. Kehoe, K.K. Steer, and T.P. Weldon, ``Thevenin Forms of Digital Discrete-Time Non-Foster RC and RL Circuits"

2. Use matlab to simulate  the results shown in Fig. 2 of the paper, for a digital series RC circuit  where T=5 ns, C =-25 pF, Rdac = 1000 ohms,  latency  = 2.5 ns, and plot results for both Rser=0 and Rser=70 ohms, similar to Fig. 2 of the paper.
